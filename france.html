      <h2 class = "infor" id = "infor"> France was a front which held many events thrgouhout World War II. France was part of the allied forces during WW2. They believed that Germany was not a danger to them, because in WW1, the Germans could not break their defense. This underestimation led to an unexpected invasion. Nazi Germany had unveiled a new tactic called Blitzkrieg or ‚Äúlightning‚Äù, which involves a fast and strong surprise attack. The French could not believe they were being invaded. The French fell to the Nazi regime. France was later re-established with the help of the UK, U.S, and France‚Äôs rebellion.
